Anagrams  Revisited

Arnab  is  a  robber  and  he  has  managed  to  rob  N   different  strings  from  Akash.  Now  he  decides  to  sell  these
strings  in  the  market  to  make  some  profit.  But,  of  all  the  strings  he  has,  he  wants  to  find  the  size  of  the  largest
anagram  group  so  that  he  can  easily  sell  that  one  first  and  make  maximum  profit  initially.  Help  him  find  the
largest  size  of  groups  of  anagrams.
An  anagram  of  a  string  is  another  string  that  contains  same  characters,  only  the  order  of  characters  can  be
different.  For  example,  “abcd”  and  “dabc”  are  anagram  of  each  other.

Input:
First  line  of  input  contains  an  integer  N,  number  of  total  strings.  Next  N   lines  contains  a  single  string  S.

Output:
Print  the  largest  size  of  group  of  anagrams  possible.

Constraints:
1<=N<=100000
1<=|S|<=50
