## Problem Statement: Longest Span##
Find the longest span between the same number in an Array. Print the number along with the span value.
(span is the distance between two numbers
ex: [1,2,3,2,1,2,1,3]   
span of 1 - 7
	2 - 5 
	3 - 6

Output: 1 - 7

## Problem Statement: All Vowels##
Write a program to read a string and check if given string contains exactly five vowels in any order. Print Yes if the condition satisfies, else print No.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem Statement: Remove 10s##
Write a program to read an integer array and remove all 10s from the array, shift the other elements towards left and fill the trailing empty positions by 0 so that the modified array is of the same length of the given array.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem Statement: Largest Difference##
Write a program to read an integer array and find the index of larger number of the two adjacent numbers with largest difference. Print the index.			

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem Statement: Repeated  characters
You  are  given  a  string  of  length  N  .  Find  the  most  repeated  character  in  the  string.  If  many  characters  appear
same  number  of  times  find  the  smallest  one  .

Input  format
First  line  contain  string  S  of  length N.

Output  format
Print  the  most  repeated  letter  in  S.

Input  Constraints
\(1  \le  N  \le  10\)

------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problem Statement: Maximum  Number
Given  an  array  of  numbers,  arrange  them  in  a  way  that  yields  the  largest  value.  For  example,  if  the  given
numbers  are  {54,  546,  548,  60},  the  arrangement  6054854654  gives  the  largest  value.

input:
First  line  contains  an  integer  N   ,  Next  line  contains  N   integers  separated  by  space.

output:
Print  the  maximum  number  that  can  be  obtained  by  using  given  numbers.

Constraints:
1<=N<=1000
1<=Number<=1000000

------------------------------------------------------------------
##Problem statement: Tokenize  string
A  string  S   of  length  L   contains  space-separated  words.  A  group  of  words  in  this  string  is  
enclosed  in  quotes. You  have  to  break  this  string  into  individual  words  without  breaking  the  parts  of  the  string  that  are  enclosed  in
quotes.

Write  a  program  to  break  the  string  S   and  print  the  tokens  
(words  and  group  of  words  enclosed  in  quotes)  of the  string.

Input  format

First  line:  S

Output  format

Print  each  token  of  the  string  S.

Constraints
$$1  ≤  L  ≤  1000$$
